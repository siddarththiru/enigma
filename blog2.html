								<h3>1. Pay attention to your syllabus</h3>
								<p>This might sound like an obvious one, but it’s also very easy to forget. Many of us fall in the trap of checking the course schedule only superficially and putting it aside very fast, just finding out from course to course what we have to do. Grading system, assignments and a guide that explains how you can access the online forums, libraries and course materials. Knowing what and how you are going to study and the materials you need can help you prepare a better study schedule and even do some things in advance.</p>

								<h3> 2. Complete your assignments and submit them on time </h3>
								<p>Yes, in online education you have a lot of flexibility, sometimes even in terms of assignment deadlines. However, it is important to make sure you don’t bend this flexibility to much. Check deadlines and submit papers on time because some professors will impose a penalty for overdue tasks. When you submit assignments on time is not only about showing respect to your teachers, but also to yourself and to your commitment to your education. The more you do it, the more confidence you’ll gain that will help you finish your degree.</p>

								<h3> 3. Engage in conversations during online classes </h3>			
								<p>One of the secrets of distance learning is that you have to find ways to stand out during webinars or any discussion that takes place in an online format with your ‘classmates’ and professors. Try to be as active as you can! It will positively contribute to the evaluation your professor will make. Plus, being an active member in online learning platforms helps you expand your knowledge and better understand the topic.</p>

								<h3> 4. Stay organized and track your progress </h3>
								<p>Organisation is one of the key-elements for becoming a successful online learner. Be mindful about where and how you keep your syllabus, assignments, reading materials or research projects. For example, you can make one big file on your computer divided into sections, so you can easily find what you’re looking for. But remember to download everything in the matching file!</p>

								<h3>5. Learn to say NO to procrastination</h3>
								<p>Many online learners have the tendency to procrastinate either by skipping online classes or by not finishing assignments. To make it hard for the instant gratification monkey to mess with you, try making a plan in advance so you know exactly when you want to watch a course or a lecture. For assignments, start researching the topic as early as possible. Note down the main ideas so you have something to work with when you start writing it. Keep the day before the deadline only for a final proofread to check misspellings, add or replace anything that you consider relevant.</p>
